Lets create a new ticket by opening our enduser URL, we're gonna create a new ticket as (Alice) or your Osticket User. Fill out the form then click, "create ticket."

<h2>Step 2</h2>

Once you've submitted your ticket, you're gonna log into your help desk portal as (Brian) or your OsTicket agent. After logging in, click on the ticket, and observe it's properties.

  ![Brian Portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82bf7b9a-6f25-48e1-bfa6-f2d637454298)

  ![Brian Views Ticket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf60a402-5d55-4c32-8886-5c7655a3acfa)

<h2>Step 3</h2>

As we observe the ticket properties, we're gonna go ahead and set the properties to the ticket as well. We're gonna update the Priority Level, Help Topic, SLA, and Assign the ticket to the appropiate department. 
 
  ![Priority Level Brian](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30153a78-1686-4701-9be0-9e2932fd7720)

  ![Help Topic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3f847d9-c299-4348-979f-9e8d8401a333)

  ![SLA Plan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cac56775-39e9-433b-b82a-a2e31592a0d0)

  ![Assign To Online Banking](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40761eac-21c6-4dae-8f6a-59e71b7d4b8e)

<h2>Step 4</h2>

After we've completed those steps as (Brian), we're gonna log out and log back in as (Liz) or another OsTicket Agent. As Liz, we'll be accepting the ticket and working it to completeion.

  ![Liz Login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f144e6e2-edd5-4d09-b779-87d40fe0b1ea)

  ![Liz Portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4787b822-2373-4bbd-a653-b859510dc4da)

  ![Liz Accepting Ticket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baed00e5-06dd-45ed-9d82-78094cf6eb20)

Now that Liz has assigned the ticket to herself, first thing that has to been done is looking into the issue and coming up with a solution. 

After Liz does some investigating, she updates the ticket and gives a solution to what cause the outage. 

  ![Liz Reply](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2baf8ff-51ab-4e97-a336-a9265d06d8b5)

  ![Liz Reply 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43f5f48f-2239-4fdf-8d9e-7d6ce572b6df)

Once you,ve posted your solution as Liz, and submitted it. Go ahead, and change the status of the ticket to "resloved" then youre all done!

  ![Ticket Resolved](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0fb5bfd-e694-4d12-8454-9d06a9cf00de)

That concludes this ticket, I hope this tutorial helps you understand the lifecycle of a ticket.

In this lab, I've learned how to create tickets, assign SLA's, departments, teams, and manage ticket ticket escalations. This type of practice helps improve ticket managemnt skills in real world help desk scenarios.
